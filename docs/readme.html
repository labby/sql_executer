	<h1>SQL-Executer is a solution to maintain your database without any other tool.</h1>
  <p>  Just crate your own sql statements end get them run.</p>
  <br /><br />
  <h3>Intention</h3><br />
  Using dbWatchSite it is a duty, to clean the tables logfiles and lock requiries.<br />
  If you have to lock requires via dbWatchSite backend it may take a lot of time.
  So I created some queries in phpmyadmin and run them there though it might be fine to run them via backend of your installation.<br />
  This admintool is the solution.<br />
  <br />
	<h3>Installation</h3><br />
	The SQL-Executer is an Admin Tool.<br />
  Just install it like any other addon via LEPTON backend.<br />
<br />
    <h3>Usage</h3><br />
    Please create your queries using phpmyadmin or something similar.<br />
    Now no select queries are possible.
    Keep in mind that you can't use the constant TABLE_PREFIX in SQL Executer.<br />
    Copy the query into the editarea and save.<br />
    Execute the query via icon.<br />
